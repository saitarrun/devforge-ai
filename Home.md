## 🎯 What Is DevForge AI?

DevForge AI is **not** a one-shot code generator. It's a **delivery workflow** that orchestrates 10 specialized agents across 5 SDLC phases:

1. **Plan** — Product manager breaks down requirements
2. **Build** — Engineers implement thin vertical slices
3. **Verify** — Security and performance checks
4. **Ship** — DevOps builds CI/CD and infrastructure
5. **Operate** — SREs define SLOs and runbooks

Each phase produces **handoff documents** so context survives phase transitions. Each build step uses the **Ralph Loop** — a self-correcting feedback loop that retries when verification fails, then stops at a circuit breaker.

### Why DevForge AI?

| Problem | DevForge Solution |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Agents build the wrong thing** | `/sdlc-plan` runs structured interviews → requirements first |
| **Work gets too big to trust** | Tracer bullet slices → thin vertical cuts through the full stack |
| **Code doesn't work** | Ralph Loop retries with bounded context → self-correction |
| **Process loses context** | Handoff documents at phase gates → survivable decisions |
| **Shipping isn't the end** | Verify, Ship, Operate phases → SLOs and runbooks before release |

## 📋 How It Works

### The Five Phases

```
/sdlc-plan ──→ /sdlc-build ──→ /sdlc-verify ──→ /sdlc-ship ──→ /sdlc-operate
    ↓               ↓               ↓               ↓               ↓
   PRD          Code & Tests    Security,      Docker,            SLOs,
 Scope.json      Designs       Performance     CI/CD              Runbooks
  Issues      Implementation                Infrastructure      Monitoring
```

Or run the **full pipeline** at once:

```bash
/sdlc "build a login page"
```

| Phase | Command | Primary Agents | Key Outputs | Read Next |

## 📦 What You Get

Every SDLC run writes into a **project folder** with structured deliverables:

```
./projects/<feature-name>/
├── grill-summary.md              # Interview notes
├── scope.json                    # Slice breakdown + flags
├── docs/
│   ├── 01-prd.md                # Product requirements
│   ├── ux-design.md             # Design specs
│   ├── implementation-log.md     # Slice-by-slice log
│   ├── security-report.md       # Security findings
│   ├── performance-report.md    # Performance data
│   └── 06-slo.md                # SLOs and monitoring
├── handoffs/
│   ├── plan-handoff.md          # Context → Build phase
│   ├── build-handoff.md         # Context → Verify phase
│   ├── verify-handoff.md        # Context → Ship phase
│   └── ship-handoff.md          # Context → Operate phase
└── code/                        # Implementation
```

Each handoff is **bounded context** — no unnecessary history, decisions preserved.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Tracer Bullet Slices

Instead of building the whole feature at once, DevForge breaks work into **thin vertical slices**:

```json
{
  "slices": [
    {
      "id": "slice-0",
      "name": "Project scaffold + health check",
      "type": "prefactor",
      "layers": ["schema", "api", "tests"]
    },
    {
      "id": "slice-1",
      "name": "User can log in",
      "type": "feature",
      "layers": ["schema", "api", "ui", "tests"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Each slice cuts through **all layers** (schema, API, UI, tests), so every increment is testable.

### The Ralph Loop

DevForge's self-correction pattern:

1. **Implement** one slice
2. **Run** type checks and tests
3. **Retry** with fresh context if verification fails
4. **Stop** at circuit breaker (don't loop silently)
5. **QA** cross-slice after feature slices complete

### Handoff-Bounded Context

Long SDLC sessions drown the model in stale history. DevForge uses **handoff documents** at phase gates:

- `plan-handoff.md` → `/sdlc-build`
- `build-handoff.md` → `/sdlc-verify`
- `verify-handoff.md` → `/sdlc-ship`
- `ship-handoff.md` → `/sdlc-operate`

Each phase reads the handoff first, then works with **bounded context**. Decisions survive, unnecessary chat does not.

## 💡 Common Workflows

### "I have a fuzzy idea"

```bash
/sdlc-plan "add two-factor authentication"
```

Runs the structured interview, produces scope and PRD. Read the requirements before building.

[Planning Guide](./Commands/sdlc-plan) →

### "I have a well-scoped issue"

```bash
/sdlc-implement /path/to/issue
```

Implements the issue with Ralph Loop retries, no planning phase needed.

[Implementation Guide](./Commands/sdlc-implement) →

### "I want the full workflow"

```bash
/sdlc "build a checkout flow"
```

Runs all 5 phases: Plan → Build → Verify → Ship → Operate. Full delivery.
