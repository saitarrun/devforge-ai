An agentic SDLC orchestration system for Claude Code. DevForge AI turns an idea into a planned, built, verified, shipped, and operated feature using role-specific agents, tracer bullet slices, quality gates, and handoff documents.

This is not a one-shot code generator. DevForge AI is a delivery workflow: product thinking first, thin vertical slices, feedback loops, security and performance checks, deployment assets, and operational follow-through.

## Quickstart

1. Install the package:

```bash
sudo npm install -g devforge-ai
```

2. Install the DevForge AI agents, skills, commands, and integrations into Claude Code:

```bash
devforge-ai install
```

3. Restart Claude Code, then run the full pipeline:

```bash
/sdlc "build a login page"
```

4. Or run one phase at a time:

```bash
/sdlc-plan "add OAuth login"
/sdlc-build
/sdlc-verify
/sdlc-ship
/sdlc-operate
```

## Install From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saitarrun/devforge-ai
cd devforge-ai
npm install
npm run install-local
```

Restart Claude Code after installing. See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for update, symlink, and uninstall instructions.

## Why DevForge AI Exists

DevForge AI is built around the common places AI-assisted engineering breaks down.

### 1. The Agent Builds The Wrong Thing

The first failure mode is misalignment. A feature request sounds obvious until the agent fills in the wrong blanks.

DevForge AI starts with `/sdlc-plan`, where the `product-manager` agent runs a structured interview, writes `grill-summary.md`, produces `scope.json`, synthesizes a PRD, and creates implementation issues. The result is a concrete build plan before any code is written.

Use this when:

- The idea is still fuzzy
- You need user stories and acceptance criteria
- You want vertical slices instead of a giant implementation blob
- You want requirements captured as artifacts, not lost in chat history

### 2. The Work Is Too Big To Trust

Large agent tasks fail because the feedback loop is too slow. DevForge AI breaks features into tracer bullet slices: thin increments that cut through schema, API, UI, and tests where needed.

Each slice is tracked in `scope.json`:

```json
{
  "capability_flags": {
    "has_ui": true,
    "has_auth": true
  },
  "slices": [
    {
      "id": "slice-0",
      "name": "Project scaffold + health check",
      "type": "prefactor",
      "layers": ["schema", "api", "tests"]
    },
    {
      "id": "slice-1",
      "name": "User can log in",
      "type": "feature",
      "layers": ["schema", "api", "ui", "tests"]
    }
  ]
}
```

The first slice establishes the foundation. Every later slice delivers one user-visible increment and appends its result to `implementation-log.md`.

### 3. The Code Does Not Work

DevForge AI uses the Ralph Loop during build work:

- Implement one slice
- Run the relevant type checks and tests
- Retry with fresh context when verification fails
- Stop at a circuit breaker instead of looping silently
- Run cross-slice QA after feature slices are complete

This gives the agent a disciplined feedback loop instead of relying on confidence.

### 4. The Process Loses Context

Long SDLC sessions can drown the model in stale conversation history. DevForge AI uses handoff documents at phase gates:

```text
plan-handoff.md   -> /sdlc-build
build-handoff.md  -> /sdlc-verify
verify-handoff.md -> /sdlc-ship
ship-handoff.md   -> /sdlc-operate
```

Each phase reads the handoff first, then starts with bounded context. Decisions survive, but unnecessary chat history does not.

### 5. Shipping Is Not The End

DevForge AI includes verification, deployment, and operations phases. The workflow does not stop when code compiles.

The later phases cover:

- Security review and OWASP checks
- Performance profiling when required
- CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, and infrastructure artifacts
- SLOs, monitoring, runbooks, and operational readiness
- Data pipeline planning when the feature needs it

## How The Pipeline Works

| Phase | Command | Primary agents | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Plan | `/sdlc-plan` | `product-manager` | `grill-summary.md`, `scope.json`, `01-prd.md`, issues |
| Build | `/sdlc-build` | `ux-designer`, `fullstack-engineer`, `qa-engineer` | `ux-design.md`, code, tests, `implementation-log.md` |
| Verify | `/sdlc-verify` | `security-engineer`, `performance-engineer` | security and performance reports |
| Ship | `/sdlc-ship` | `devops-engineer` | CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, IaC, release notes |
| Operate | `/sdlc-operate` | `sre-engineer`, `data-engineer` | SLOs, runbooks, monitoring, data pipeline docs |

Some agents are scope-gated:

- `ux-designer` runs when `has_ui` is true
- `performance-engineer` runs when `needs_performance_audit` is true
- `data-engineer` runs when `has_data_pipeline` is true
- Security monitoring is added when `has_auth` is true

## Project Artifacts

Every SDLC run writes into a project folder:

```text
./projects/<feature-name>/
  grill-summary.md
  scope.json
  docs/
    01-prd.md
    ux-design.md
    implementation-log.md
    security-report.md
    performance-report.md
    05-pipeline.log
    06-slo.md
  handoffs/
    plan-handoff.md
    build-handoff.md
    verify-handoff.md
    ship-handoff.md
```

## Reference
